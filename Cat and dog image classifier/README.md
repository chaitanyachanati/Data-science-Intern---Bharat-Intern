# Cat and Dog Image Classifier
## Used Machine Learning and Neural Networking to create a classifier to classify images as cats and dogs

As part of Bharat inter, I have done the project "Cat And Dog Image Classifier", which creates a model that classifies mixed images of cats and dogs as either cats or dogs. I used Convolutional Neural Networks for classification.This project made me comfortable working with deep learning and images and made me feel more motivated with image-based projects.
